GALPY is an open-source Python library designed to facilitate galaxy evolution modeling.



GALPY provides tools for simulating galaxy evolution, including dark matter halo formation, gas accretion and star formation, as well as observational signatures like spectra and images. It includes a suite of algorithms for solving the gravitational equation and tracking galaxy-scale dynamics, allowing users to model realistic galaxy simulations.
