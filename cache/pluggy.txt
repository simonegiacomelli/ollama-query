Python is an excellent choice for building custom plugins!



pluggy is a Python library that simplifies the process of writing plugins by providing a flexible and extensible framework for loading and managing plugins. It allows you to define plugin interfaces, discover and load plugins at runtime, and manage their dependencies and configurations. pluggy is particularly useful when you need to create a multi-plugin system where each plugin has its own set of functionality and can be easily extended or modified.
