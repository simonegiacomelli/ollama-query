Python's built-in support for rich text formatting is limited, but the "rich" library helps to fill this gap. 



The "rich" library allows you to create rich text, with features like bold and italic text, strikethroughs, and more. It also supports rendering of tables, progress bars, and other complex layouts. This makes it easy to create visually appealing output in your Python applications.
