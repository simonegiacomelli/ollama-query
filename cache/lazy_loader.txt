Python is an excellent language for building data-intensive applications, and its extensive library collection makes it even more powerful.



The lazy_loader library in Python is designed to simplify the process of loading large datasets into memory. It does this by allowing you to lazily load your data from a variety of sources, such as databases or files, only when it's actually needed. This approach can greatly improve the performance and efficiency of your applications by reducing the amount of memory they need to use.
