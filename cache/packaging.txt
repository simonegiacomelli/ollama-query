The packaging library in Python is designed to assist developers in creating, distributing, and installing software packages.



Packaging is used for managing dependencies between Python projects and their respective requirements. It provides tools for building, testing, and distributing packages. With packaging, you can create a package that includes all the necessary components such as code, documentation, and data files.
