The netCDF4 library is a Python interface to the netCDF (network Common Data Form) file format.



The netCDF4 library provides a Pythonic interface to the netCDF-4 and HDF5 data formats. It allows users to create, read, write, and manipulate these files. This makes it an excellent choice for working with large-scale datasets in scientific research and other fields where complex numerical simulations are used.
