The Python library "ipython" is an interactive shell.



Ipython provides an enhanced environment for working in python's command-line interface (CLI). It offers features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and the ability to easily execute code blocks. This makes it a powerful tool for data exploration, scientific computing, and education.
