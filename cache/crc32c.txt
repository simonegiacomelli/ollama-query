The Python library "crc32c" is used to compute cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) for binary data.



The crc32c module provides a way to calculate a 32-bit CRC value from a given sequence of bytes. It is based on the polynomial used in the CRC-32C standard, which is commonly used in file systems and network protocols. The function takes a byte string as input and returns a 4-byte integer representing the calculated CRC value. This library can be useful for data integrity checks, error detection, and checksum calculations.
