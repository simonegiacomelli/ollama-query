The Python library "jsonschema_specifications" is used to create JSON schema specifications for data validation.




This library provides functions to generate and validate JSON schema specifications from dictionaries. It also supports recursive structures and includes additional features like support for $ref and definitions. The generated schemas can be used with popular libraries such as jsonschema, allowing for easy data validation in Python applications.
