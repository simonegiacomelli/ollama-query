Python's `mpmath` library is a complex math library that provides support for arbitrary-precision floating point arithmetic.




`mpmath` is a Python library that provides support for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic. It allows you to work with extremely large and small numbers, with precision controlled by the user. This makes it particularly useful for scientific computing, where accurate calculations are crucial. The library includes advanced mathematical functions such as elliptic integrals and modular forms, and can be used to solve problems in a wide range of fields, including physics, engineering, and mathematics.
