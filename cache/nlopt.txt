The `nlopt` library is a Python interface to the NLopt optimization algorithm.



The `nlopt` library provides an interface to the NLopt (Nonlinearly Constrained Optimization) library. It allows you to solve unconstrained and constrained optimization problems using various algorithms, including gradient-based methods, quadratic programming, and more. The library supports both minimization and maximization of functions with one or multiple variables.
