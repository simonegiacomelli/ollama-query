The cftime library is used for handling calendar and datetime computations.



The cftime library provides support for dates and times in Python, including operations such as adding years, months, days to dates, and converting between different date formats. It also supports leap year calculations and time zone conversions. The library is particularly useful when working with large datasets that require precise date and time manipulation.
