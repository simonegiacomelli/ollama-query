Prime numbers have been a subject of interest in number theory for thousands of years. They are an essential part of many areas of mathematics, including cryptography.


   


PrimeCountPy is a Python library that provides efficient methods to count prime numbers up to a given limit. It uses a combination of sieve algorithms and mathematical formulas to achieve high performance. The library includes functions to count the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given number, as well as more advanced functions for counting prime numbers in specific ranges.
