Msgpack is a Python library that provides an efficient way to serialize and deserialize data structures into binary messages.



The msgpack library allows you to convert Python objects into compact binary messages and vice versa. It's often used in network communication protocols where speed and efficiency are crucial, such as in game servers or real-time collaboration tools. Msgpack supports serializing and deserializing of various data types including dictionaries, lists, integers, floats, strings, and more. It also provides an optional extension mechanism to allow custom serialization for specific use cases.
