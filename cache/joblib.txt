Joblib is a Python library that simplifies the process of parallelizing CPU-bound tasks by providing high-level interfaces to popular parallel processing frameworks such as joblib.parallel.Parallel, joblib.parallel.DistributedParallel and joblib.parallel.BlockedParallel.

 

Joblib provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for parallelizing loops, allowing developers to easily distribute their computations across multiple cores or nodes. It also includes various features such as automatic handling of dependencies between tasks, support for asynchronous execution, and integration with popular scientific computing libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
