Python is used extensively in the development of documentation systems.


 

Docutils is an open-source Python library for generating documentation from plain-text source files. It allows you to write your documentation using simple, yet powerful syntax and converts it into various formats such as HTML, PDF, ePub, Texinfo, man page, etc.
