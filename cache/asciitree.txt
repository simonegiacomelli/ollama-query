Python is a powerful tool for creating ASCII art.



asciitree is a Python library that allows you to generate ASCII tree diagrams from nested data structures. It provides a simple way to visualize hierarchical data in a text-based format, making it useful for debugging, documentation, and presentation purposes. With asciitree, you can easily convert complex data structures like lists, dictionaries, or objects into readable ASCII art.
