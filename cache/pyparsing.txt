pyparsing is a powerful Python library that provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.



pyparsing allows you to define grammar rules and parse strings based on those rules. This can be used for tasks such as tokenizing input data, parsing file formats, or extracting specific information from text. The library includes various tools for building parsers, including a powerful expression language that is similar to, but more expressive than, traditional regular expressions.
