Async-timeout provides support for timeouts in asynchronous code. It is designed to be used with asyncio, Python's built-in library for asynchronous programming.



The async-timeout library allows you to set a timeout for your asynchronous operations, which can be useful when working with APIs or other network resources that may take too long to respond. This prevents your program from blocking indefinitely if the operation takes longer than expected. The library provides several functions and classes for setting timeouts, including `timeout`, `TimeoutError`, and `TimeoutContext`. With async-timeout, you can write more robust and responsive asynchronous code that handles timeouts effectively.
