The lxml library is an implementation of the libxml2 and libxslt libraries in Python.

 

lxml provides support for parsing HTML and XML documents, as well as tools for querying and manipulating the contents of these documents. It includes facilities for searching, filtering, and transforming the data contained within the documents. Additionally, it supports converting between different forms of data, such as XML to JSON or CSV.
