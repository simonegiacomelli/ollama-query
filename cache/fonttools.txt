Python is an excellent language for data analysis and scientific computing.



FontTools is a Python library that provides a set of tools for working with fonts, including font parsing, rendering, and manipulation. It allows developers to create and edit fonts, as well as extract information about font characteristics such as name, style, and size. FontTools supports various font formats, including TrueType, OpenType, and PostScript. The library is particularly useful for developing applications that require advanced font handling capabilities, such as text editors, word processors, and publishing software.
