Cycler is a Python library that simplifies the process of creating cycle plots using matplotlib.



Cycler allows you to create custom cycle styles by defining different markers, line styles, and colors for each cycle. It provides an easy-to-use interface for specifying these options and can be used with other plotting libraries like seaborn and plotly.
