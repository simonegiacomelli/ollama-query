The `wcwidth` library in Python provides functions to calculate the width of a string in characters, taking into account different languages' character widths.





This library is particularly useful for handling Unicode characters and calculating their widths correctly. It also provides functionality to determine the direction of text (left-to-right or right-to-left) and to detect whether a character is wide or narrow.
