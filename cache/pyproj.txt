The Python library "pyproj" is designed to work with projections, which are used in geospatial applications to transform spatial data from one coordinate system to another.



The pyproj library provides an implementation of the PROJ.4 cartographic projection library, allowing you to perform transformations between different projected and geographic coordinate systems. It supports a wide range of projections, including those commonly used for GIS and mapping applications.
