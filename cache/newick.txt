Newick is a Python library that allows you to easily create and manipulate phylogenetic trees in the Newick format.


Newick trees are a standard representation of phylogenetic relationships between organisms. They can be used to store information about the evolutionary history of a group of species, including their relationships with one another and the timing of their divergences.
