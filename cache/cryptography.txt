The cryptography library for Python is a comprehensive collection of cryptographic primitives.



The "cryptography" library provides a wide range of cryptographic tools and primitives. It includes support for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, key exchange, and message authentication codes (MACs). The library also offers secure hash functions, random number generation, and key wrapping. With this library, you can perform various tasks such as encrypting data, generating keys, and verifying signatures.
