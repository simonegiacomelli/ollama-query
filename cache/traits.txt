The traits library in Python provides a way to define classes that have specific properties or behaviors. It allows you to specify constraints on class instances using type-like declarations.




Traits are essentially special kinds of classes that allow you to create classes that have certain characteristics or attributes, which can be useful for defining complex data structures or performing calculations.
