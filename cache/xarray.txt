xarray is an open-source library that provides data structures and operations for multi-dimensional arrays in Python. It's designed to efficiently handle large datasets, often used in scientific computing and data analysis.



xarray allows users to easily manipulate and analyze large datasets with labeled axes, similar to Pandas DataFrames. It also supports advanced indexing, grouping, and aggregating capabilities, making it a powerful tool for working with multi-dimensional arrays in Python.
