The Freesasa library is an open-source Python package for fast and efficient computation of molecular properties.




Freesasa is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for calculating various molecular properties such as molecular volume, surface area, and shape descriptors. It uses a combination of techniques including Gaussian approximation, spatial partitioning, and optimized algorithms to achieve high performance and accuracy. The library supports a wide range of file formats and can be easily integrated into larger computational pipelines.
