The `re` library provides support for regular expressions in Python.



The `re` module offers a wide range of functions to operate with regular expressions. It allows you to specify patterns as strings and then use these patterns to match against strings or search through files. The most common function is `search()`, which returns the first occurrence of the pattern in the string, or `None` if it's not found. Other functions include `match()`, `findall()`, and `sub()` for replacing occurrences.
