The cssselect library provides a way to select elements from an HTML document using CSS-like selectors.



The cssselect library allows you to parse CSS selectors and use them to select elements from an HTML document. It supports most of the standard CSS3 selector syntax, including classes, tags, IDs, and combinators. You can also use it to manipulate the selected elements by adding or removing attributes, setting text content, or even modifying the DOM structure itself. This library is particularly useful when you need to parse and select HTML elements in a Python application.
