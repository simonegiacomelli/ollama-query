Python is a powerful language for various purposes, including data analysis and processing.


 

The python-magic library allows you to analyze and identify types of files (like images, audio, video) based on their binary patterns. It's often used in conjunction with other libraries like OpenEXI or Pillow. The library provides a simple interface that makes it easy to extract information about the type of file you're working with, which can be useful for things like file indexing and searching.
