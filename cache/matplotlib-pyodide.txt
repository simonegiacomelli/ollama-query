Python is known for its simplicity and versatility in data analysis and visualization.

 

matplotlib-pyodide allows Python programs to run in web browsers, using PyODIDE's ability to run Python code on the client-side. It provides a subset of matplotlib's plotting functionality, allowing users to create interactive plots that can be shared and viewed directly within web pages.
