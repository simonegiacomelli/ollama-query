Fiona is a Python library that provides an interface to geographic data formats.



Fiona reads and writes data in over 100 geospatial formats, including common raster formats like GeoTIFF, DTED, and MrSID, as well as vector formats like ESRI Shapefile, MapInfo File, and more. It's particularly useful for working with large datasets that need to be converted or manipulated. Fiona is often used alongside other popular libraries like GDAL and GeoPandas to provide a comprehensive toolkit for geospatial data processing.
