The requests library is an essential tool for working with HTTP requests in Python.




The requests library allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. It provides a simple way to work with URLs and make HTTP requests. You can use it to send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of requests. The library also provides support for JSON data, files, and other types of content. With requests, you can easily fetch web pages, interact with RESTful APIs, and more.
