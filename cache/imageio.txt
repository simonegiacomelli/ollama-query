Imageio is a Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface for reading and writing image files in various formats.



Imageio allows you to read and write images in a variety of file formats, including popular ones like JPEG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF. It also supports some less common formats like DICOM, HDR, and Exif. One of the key features of imageio is its ability to handle multiple frames in an image sequence (such as an animation or a video frame), making it a great tool for working with multimedia data.
