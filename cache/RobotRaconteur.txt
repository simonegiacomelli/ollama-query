RobotRaconteur is an open-source Python library that provides a high-level interface to various robotic platforms.


 

RobotRaconteur allows developers to create software applications that interact with robots from different manufacturers and platforms. It abstracts away the complexities of communicating with individual robot APIs, providing a unified way to control and retrieve data from a wide range of robots. This enables users to focus on developing their own robotics applications without worrying about the underlying hardware or software differences between the various robotic platforms.
