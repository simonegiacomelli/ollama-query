The jsonschema library is used to validate JSON data against a JSON schema.



jsonschema provides an easy way to work with JSON Schemas in Python. It allows you to validate JSON data against a JSON schema and also generates JSON schema from an existing JSON document or Python dictionary. The validation process ensures that the JSON data conforms to the defined structure, including type constraints, required properties, and nested structures.
