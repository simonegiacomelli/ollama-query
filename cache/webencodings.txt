The Python library "webencodings" is used for handling various web encodings, such as UTF-7, UTF-8, and UTF-16.


   The webencodings library provides classes for encoding and decoding strings using these different encodings. It also includes helper functions to test if a string can be successfully decoded in a given encoding. This makes it easier for developers to work with text data that may contain multiple encodings.
