Soupsieve is a Python library for searching HTML documents using CSS selectors.



Soupsieve provides an easy way to find specific parts of a web page's content by using CSS selectors in a similar manner as the BeautifulSoup library does with XPath expressions. This allows you to quickly locate and manipulate elements on a webpage without having to navigate through its hierarchical structure.
