The Python library "pycparser" is a lightweight, easy-to-use parser that can parse C code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It's useful for working with existing C codebases or generating C code programmatically.



pycparser provides a simple way to analyze and manipulate C source code. With it, you can parse C files, traverse the AST, and extract information about the code structure and contents. This makes it a great tool for tasks such as refactoring, debugging, and code analysis.
