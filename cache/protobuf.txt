Python's protobuf library is a fantastic tool for serializing data.



protobuf is a Python implementation of the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) data format. It provides an efficient way to serialize and deserialize structured data in a compact binary format. The protobuf format is language-agnostic, making it easy to work with other programming languages that also have protobuf implementations.
