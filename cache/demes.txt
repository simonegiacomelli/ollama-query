demes is a Python library for estimating demographic parameters from genetic data.



demes allows users to estimate demographic parameters such as effective population sizes, growth rates, and migration rates from genetic data. It uses a Bayesian approach and can handle complex demographic scenarios with multiple populations and events. The library provides a range of models and tools for analyzing genetic data, including simulations, likelihood calculations, and model selection techniques.
